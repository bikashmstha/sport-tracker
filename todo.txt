- migrate to the latest ng2
    - need to evaluate / decide upon a starter kit / CLI
- connect to a "real" back-end

THINGS TO LEARN:
    - setup
    - http/fetch + RxJS or any other reasonable data flow solution
    - forms:
        - validation
        - data conversion
        - model-driven forms
        - encapsulating common code
    - lists
        - sortable / filtrable / paginable list in ng2
        - data flow into list components
        - fetching non trivial data and data flow (or how to connect tracks to activities list)


THINGS TO EXPLORE / FIX:
    - inputs of type data / input conversion
    - factoring out common code for data fields
    - http vs. fetch
    - data flow: observables vs. promises vs. immutable
